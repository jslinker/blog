preview: Every Arch in the Park
---

Arches is my absolute favorite of Utah's national parks. It might not have the best hikes, but it does have the best destinations for its hikes. Since we'd been to Arches before, we decided to take on a challenge, to see 10 unique destinations in the 24 hours we had in the park. I wouldn't recommend this for a first time visit, but I felt like we really pushed what was possible in a single day and had a blast doing it.
