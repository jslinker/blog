preview: My favorite short hike in Utah Valley
---

Not every destination can be wild and adventurous. I might even say that Stewart Falls is the opposite of our more exotic destinations. It's fun. It's comfortable. It's exactly what you want in a short mountain hike.

Starting from the Aspen Grove trailhead the climb to the falls is an easy 1.5 miles through the Timpanogos forrest. Most people enjoy this hike in the late summer but, as you can see from the video, more adventurous hikers can have just as much fun in the dead of winter.

Depending on the year and the season the falls can range from massive and roaring to a completely frozen monolith. Regardless of which version of the falls you experience it is always worth the trip.

Alright! Why are you still reading? Get out there and hike!
