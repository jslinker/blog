Huge news everyone! We're having a baby girl on May 19th!

Okay, now that's out of the way, let's get on with the post.

Utah Valley is only a 6 hour drive from Las Vegas and as such it's a favorite of ours for a weekend getaway. As members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) you might be surprised to hear that Vegas is a go-to for us. Well if you're the type of person that likes good food, good shows, and doing it without the usual debauchery associated with Vegas then this trip is for you.

In my opinion, the most important part of any trip is good food. In Vegas we think that the best food on The Strip is at [The Wicked Spoon](https://www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com/restaurants/wicked-spoon). Located in the beautiful Cosmopolitan hotel, The Wicked Spoon is a luxury buffet with influences from all over the world. The menu does change, but the never-changing highlight is the gelato bar. On your next trip I'd recommend trying the "jalape√±o pineapple" gelato.

After our filling our bellies we scampered off to The Mirage for the long-running [The Beatles LOVE](https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/beatles-love) show. We've seen Cirque du Soleil all over the country and they never disappoint. Some might argue that some of the other Cirque shows on the strip are more impressive with their spectacle, but for a couple die hard Beatles fans we couldn't pass this show up.

Now I'll be the first to admit that both The Wicked Spoon and Cirque du Soleil aren't exactly budget friendly. If you're looking for a great time without breaking the bank then we've got options for you. The [Coca Cola store](https://www.cokestore.com/stores/las-vegas/) features an attractions that's both entertaining and delicious: Around the World drink tastings. In the upper level diner you an order trays full of dozens of Coke's most popular drinks around the world. Like Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, most are delicious and some are down right awful. I'd recommend letting a friend be the one to taste the "Beverly."

After some refreshing drinks you can head across the street to the New York, New York hotel for two more favorites. Typically I would recommend Raising Cane's for some unique fast food, but if I have time to walk the strip then I always go to Shake Shack. If you don't know why I'd recommend the New York native burger joint, then take the time to Google it. It live up to the hype.

Staying in the same vicinity you can walk upstairs to The Roller Coaster, previously known as the Big Apple Coaster, previously known as the Manhattan Express. I won't linger too long here because we didn't have time on this trip for it, but I will say that it's worth it. It's absolutely thrilling to be riding around a corner and have the track disappear revealing a great view of The Strip.

Las Vegas for most people lives up to its mantra "what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas," but we love the wholesome diamonds in the rough that this city has to offer.
