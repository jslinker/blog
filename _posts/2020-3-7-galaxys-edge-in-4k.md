There's been a lot of buzz about filming "cinematic" videos with iPhone 11 Pro, FiLMiC Pro, and a gimbal. While visiting Galaxy's Edge and Disneyland we decided to try our hand at filming a cinematic short video we call "A Child's Eyes." It's our attempt to capture Lucy's first experience in the Magic Kingdom.

Look forward to more videos showcasing Disneyland, California Adventure, and Galaxy's Edge later this summer. We also have several more "60 Second Travel" videos coming out every other week so make sure to subscribe and ring the bell to make sure that you see the latest videos.
