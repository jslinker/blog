preview: La'ie Hawaii in 60 Seconds
---

Visiting La'ie might not be at the top of everyone's list but it should be. Everything on Oahu's North Shore is magical, but there's something special about driving along the coast and turning up the long drive to the LDS temple.

In our previous video we referred to La'ie as the "Mormon side of Hawaii," and that's because BYU Hawaii, the temple, and the Polynesian Cultural Center are all within a 5 minute drive of each other. Even if you're not a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it's easy to appreciate everything that this corner of Oahu has to offer.
