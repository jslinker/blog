                <h1>Yellowstone</h1>
                <p>Let’s get this out of the way up front: <a href="https://www.yellowstonepark.com/things-to-do/about-old-faithful">Old Faithful</a> is cool, but it’s not the best part of Yellowstone.</p>

<p>Whew. I’m glad we got that out of the way. I know it’s the most iconic part of Yellowstone, but there are some amazing sites in Yellowstone and we saw most of them.</p>

<p>I’ve always been a lover of the National Parks of the United States. Growing up in Utah spoiled me with easy access to Arches, Zion, and the others of the <a href="https://www.visitutah.com/places-to-go/parks-outdoors/the-mighty-5/">Mighty 5</a>. Having visited these excellent sites is more than most people have done, but it still feels bad to know that Yellowstone is 6 hours away and I’ve never been. Despite being 6 months pregnant, Hannah decided to fix that longing for me.</p>

<p>From the moment we entered the park we were completely immersed in the experience. Buffalo blocked the roads, massive fowl were floating down the river, and of course the ever present steam pouring from the ground. It’s impossible to explain that feeling of being transported to a fantasy wilderness that you get when driving into Yellowstone.</p>

<p>To be brief I just want to highlight the one site that took my breah more than any other: <a href="https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/yell-grand-canyon-of-the-yellowstone.htm">The Grand Canyon</a>. Before taking that drive up to Wyoming I didn’t realize that there was more than one Grand Canyon. Although the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is much smaller than the more popular of the two canyons, it still earned every letter of its name.</p>

<p>Every one of the dozens of lookout points was worth stopping for. All of the views looked out over the rushing river that carved that great canyon. One spot revealed the rapids coming around the bend, another put us right next massive falls. All I wanted to do was fly my drone down the river and off the falls to capture every inch of it (which of course I didn’t do). That river became one of my favorite sites on Earth.</p>

<p>Go to Yellowstone. Find a way to get there. A park pass isn’t expensive and once inside the sites are all free. You won’t regret it.</p>
