                <h1>Mount Timpanogos</h1>
                <p>I consider Mount Timpanogos <em>my</em> mountain. Growing up with the 9th tallest peak in Utah right outside my door had an enchanting effect. Timpanogos is full of memories of hard hiking, good skiing, and summer picnics.</p>

<p>When I was in college I carried a season pass to <a href="https://www.sundanceresort.com">Sundance Resort</a> for years. In recent years I’ve fallen off the horse, so to speak, with snowboarding and this year I’ve got Patrick to thank for putting me right back on. I always love riding at Sundance, but this day had a little something extra. Early in the day a low covering of clouds began creeping up the canyon. At the start of every run we took a moment to look down the slopes at a transformed landscape. Familiar peaks became the Misty Mountains right in front of eyes. It was breathtaking.</p>

<p>Turn the clock back 4 months to the warm summer months when ski slopes become hiking trails and you’d find Hannah and I on the exact same mountain. We decided to spend a Saturday morning hustling up the summit of Timpanogos. In previous years we’ve summitted the mountain in a comfortable 6 to 8 hours. This year we did it in 5. Just like every physical feat we’ve taken on Hannah pushed me to do my best and it made for a one-of-a-kind hike.</p>

<p>The next time you’re feeling adventurous you should go discover the magic that Timpanogos has to offer.</p>
