                <h1>Paris In 60 Seconds</h1>
                <p>When you’re in Paris you have to try and do it all. From the Eiffel Tower, to Mont Marte, to Sacre Coeur; the city is brimming with rich history and delicious food. We were lucky enough to see Notre Dame before and after the fire. Our friends took us to see The Thinker at the Rodin museum. Hannah had a dream fulfilled of seeing the Water Lilies at the Musée de l’Orangerie. 60 seconds isn’t much, but we hope you enjoy this little glimpse of Paris as much as we did.</p>
